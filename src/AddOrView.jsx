//this page will just display instructions and two buttons: a button that leads to a place where they can manually import or import a CSV for start-of semester planning, and the other button leads straight to the to-do list.
//Maybe I can add something on the semester planning (like a date where the semester ends) and if the date when the semester ends hasn't passed, it just goes straight to the to-do list part if something has already been made for the semester.
