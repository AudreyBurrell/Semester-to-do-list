# Assignment Tracker
A web application designed for college students to organize and manage their academic assignemnts throughout the semester. Students can track assignment due dates, set suggested start dates, and visualize their workload in daily, weekly, and monthly views.

I got this idea because I've been encountering a lot of different ways that people keep track of their assignments, and each of them are hard to make for various reasons. I usually use a Google Sheet so I can check things off, but I have to manually create the dates. A problem that I've run into with using Google Calander is that it's hard to check off assignments and it can get super cluttered. 

## Features 
* **Add Assignments** - Create assignments with names, start dates, and due dates. The user can do this from a main page where they can add all the assignments for the semester (either manually or through CSV) and also on the daily/weekly/monthly views to manually add other things.
* **Check Off Completed Work** - Mark assignments as complete.
* **Multiple View Options** - The user can choose to have daily view, weekly overview, and monthly calendar view with month navigation. 
* **User Authentication** - Login and create account functionality, goes along with the backend for storing assignments.
* **Storing** - Assignments saved accross sessions
